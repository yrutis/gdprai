          <p class="text-justify mb-1">Data protection is the process of protecting data and thus the privacy of the
            person. Data is
            indispensable and is available at all the stages of the data processing: from its collection, use
            and transfer, to its storage and erasure. Data protection shall safeguard data from
            corruption, compromise, misuse or loss.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">As more and more data is created, collected, processed, transferred and stored,
            the
            importance of data protection is constantly increasing.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">
            Personal data security is of major interest for individuals, as personal data ending in the
            wrong hands can have severe consequences for the concerned individuals. Harmful
            consequences can vary from becoming victim of criminal activities such as phishing scams,
            identity theft, stolen banking information, to having private information used with harmful
            intent without the concerned individual’s consent.

              <h4>The GDPR and European data protection regulations</h4>
            </mat-panel-title>
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the new European law on data
            protection.
            The GDPR entered into force on the 24 th of May 2016 and has been applicable as of the 25 th
            of May 2018. Since then, companies and organizations are required to be compliant with
            this regulation.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">This regulation sets out data protection rules: it is designed to give
            individuals more control
            over their data, over how their data is collected, used and protected. It also obliges
            organizations and companies to comply with strict new rules on how to use and secure the
            personal data they collect. Ensuring transparency as well as providing individuals
            information on how their data is being used are the goals of this new regulation.
            Organizations and companies that fail to comply with these new rules face heavy penalties.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">
            The GDPR establishes a uniform framework for data protection legislation across the EU.
            Instead of each member state having their own data protection laws, all member states are
            now governed by a single regulation. This is of great advantage for organizations and
            companies as they do not need to comply with 28 different data protection laws anymore, in
            order to offer their services in all EU member states. If this is mainly true, member states
            keep however the right to regulate some fields more extensively when allowed by the GDPR.
            Hence slight regulatory differences between member states might remain.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">
            In the context of this project, legal questions on data protection raised by the creation of a
            health related app will only be discussed with regards to the GDPR. National regulations will
            not be taken into account.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">
            Concerning the material scope of the GDPR, the regulation applies to the processing of
            personal data, when this data is entirely or partially processed by automated systems or
            when it is processed with the intention to integrate this data in a filing system (art. 2 GDPR).
            In the light of the above statement, if no personal data is processed (explanations on what
            “personal data” and “process” mean will be given in the section “some definitions”), the
            GDPR doesn’t apply. Furthermore, there are a few exceptions where the GDPR doesn’t apply
            when personal data is processed (cf. art. 2(2) GDPR). One of these exceptions is the
            processing of personal data in the context of purely personal or household activities.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">
            Regarding the territorial scope of the GDPR, the regulation applies to any organization
            established within the European Union, as well as to any other organization within or
            outside the EU but that processes personal data of EU residents (art. 3 GDPR). This is the so-
            called “extra-territorial effect” of the GDPR.

                Personal data that has been irreversibly anonymized is no longer considered personal data

              <p class="text-justify mb-1">As the processing of sensitive personal data requires a higher level of
                protection than the
                processing of personal data due to the inherent risk of this processing, special rules apply.
                According to Article 9 GDPR processing sensitive personal data is basically forbidden.
                However, there are exceptions and the prohibition can be lifted if one of the requirements
                listed in Article 9(2) GDPR is met.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">Hence, for the lawful processing of sensitive personal data, the data
                controller is required to
                have a valid exception motif based on Article 9 GDPR, in addition to a lawful reason to
                process personal data based on Article 6 GDPR.</p>

              </mat-expansion-panel-header>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">The GDPR sets a high standard for the obtention of consent. The conditions
                for consent are
                defined in Article 7 GDPR. Additionally, Article 8 GDPR defines the applicable conditions for
                obtaining a child’s consent.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">“Freely given” consent essentially means that the data controllers should not
                corner the
                data subject into agreeing to the processing of their data. Hence, the obtention of the
                consent cannot be presented as a condition for using the company services. The data subject
                must have genuine and free choice and must be able to refuse or withdraw consent without
                detriment.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">“Specific consent” means that the request for consent should be presented in
                a way that
                clearly distinguishes this question from other matters. The data controller must get separate
                consent for each type of data processing operation. He must give the user an opportunity to
                confirm or decline each type of use. If the data controller has more than one purpose to
                conduct data processing, he must obtain consent for each different purpose.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">“Informed consent” means the data subject knows the data processor’s
                identity, which
                personal data will be processed, the purpose of the data processing, and users must be
                made aware of their right to withdraw their consent at any time. It also means that these
                pieces of information have to be shared in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using
                clear and plain language.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">“Unambiguous consent” means it should be a certainty that the data subject
                has consented.
                The data controller must provide an opt-in system for the collection of the data subject’s
                consent. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity does not constitute consent.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">Consent can be revoke. Data subjects have the right to withdraw their consent
                at any time.
                The data controller must make the consent withdrawal process uncomplicated and easily
                accessible.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">In the context of the processing of sensitive personal data based on the data
                subject’s
                consent, the process to obtain consent is even more rigorous. Additional information from
                the ones mentioned above might need to be provided and the data processor must explain
                even more clearly how the data will be processed.</p>

              <p class="text-justify mb-1">Our company will comply with all these requirements through its privacy

                to give their consent regarding the processing of their personal data, as well as over the
                processing of their sensitive data. The users will opt-in if they consent, and will be able to do
                so for each different processing activity on their data. Our company will inform them about

          <p class="text-justify mb-1">The GDPR imposes many different legal obligations on the data controller in order
            to make
            sure personal data is well safeguarded. The regulation also imposes obligations to ensure the
            right measures are taken in case of a data breach. The data processor has legal obligations as
            well, but this doesn’t concern our company, as we don’t rely on processors. In accordance
            with the accountability principle (cf. section “Observed Principle when processing Your
            Data”), the data controller is responsible for complying with the Regulation and needs to
            establish appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data protection.</p>
          <p class="text-justify mb-1">Here is an overview of some of these legal tools and obligations, classified in
            three different

                    section “Observed Principle when processing Your Data”). The data controller has to adopt a
                    privacy-first approach. For example, the data controller should ensure that personal data is
                    not automatically made public unless users decide to change the settings. By default the
                    settings should protect the user privacy.</p>

                    Hence the goal of the DPIA is to minimize risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.
                    The data controllers must do such an assessment when the data processing process is

              <p class="text-justify mb-1">The GDPR primarily applies to data controllers located in EU/EEA member
                states. Hence,
                when personal data is transferred outside of these territories, there is a risk for data subjects
                to lose the protection of the GDPR. In the light of the above considerations, the GDPR
                provides special rules on international personal data transfers (Art. 44-50 GDPR).</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">In accordance with Article 44 GDPR, personal data can only be transferred to
                third countries
                when certain conditions regarding data security are met in the third country where data is
                transferred, as well as in other third countries where the data could further be transferred.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">The data controller can lawfully transfer personal data on the basis of an
                “adequacy
                decision” (Art. 45 GDPR). Such a decision is taken by the European Commission, when it has
                decided that a third country, a territory or specified sectors within a third country ensure an
                adequate level of protection.</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">In the absence of an adequacy decision the data controller can transfer
                personal data to a
                third country or an international organization only if the controller has put in place
                appropriate safeguards for the security of the data and on condition that legal remedies are
                available to data subjects (Art. 46 GDPR).</p>
              <p class="text-justify mb-1">If the international transfer does not fulfil the conditions of Article 45
                GDPR, nor the ones in
                Article 46 GDPR, then the transfer is most likely not lawful. There are however some
                exceptions (Art. 49 GDPR), one of them being the data subject’s consent. Agreements
                between countries regarding the implementation of appropriate safeguards are relevant as
                well and must be taken into account.</p>
