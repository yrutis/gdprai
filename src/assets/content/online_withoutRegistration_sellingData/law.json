      "textCondensed": "To lawfully process personal data our company has to rely on one of the possible lawful reasons listed in Art. 6 GDPR. Two of those lawful reasons to process data are the obtention of users’ consent or legal obligations. Our company could theoretically rely on those two reasons depending on the situation. However, our company will only rely on consent and therefore make sure to have obtained it from its users before processing personal data. \nFor the processing of sensitive data, specific rules apply. The processing of sensitive personal data is basically forbidden. However, Art. 9 GDPR lists some exceptions where sensitive data can be processed. One of the exceptions, among others, is the user’s consent again. This is the exception our company relies on to process these data. \nHence, to process sensitive personal data companies have to rely on one lawful reason from Art. 6 GDPR as well as on one lawful exception from Art. 9 GDPR. In our case, we rely on users’ consent in both situations.  \nIn this scenario, our company only processes sensitive personal data. But as sensitive personal data is a special category personal data, there is no difference regarding the lawful reasons for data processing between this scenario (without registration) and the scenario where sensitive personal data, as well as strictly personal data, is processed (with registration).",

The processing of personal data for this purpose is explained in a clear and transparent way in our app’s privacy policy. The user can freely choose to give our company her/his consent or not. \nAs the GDPR mainly applies in the European Union, users risk losing the protection of the Regulation if their data leaves the EU territorial scope. To avoid that, the GDPR provides special rules for data transfers outside of the EU: these transfers are prohibited, except for cases where the protection is further guaranteed, even after the transfer. This can, for instance, be the case when an adequacy decision has been rendered, when the companies appropriately safeguard further data protection, or when agreements on security standards have been made. \nOur company acts lawfully by grounding its sale activities on your agreement and by making sure all transfers outside the EU fulfill the conditions to make such transfer legal.",
