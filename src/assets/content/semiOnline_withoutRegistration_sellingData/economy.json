      "textCondensed": "In this scenario, we will collect and sell not directly identifiable data. Like this, consumers are less concerned about giving their healthcare data to any third party. Further, they can benefit from app improvements made based on the internal processing of the not directly identifiable data. The processed data can also help public third parties to make predictions or derive explanations for social health patterns.",

There is no risk of reputational loss due to misuse of data since the collected data is not directly linked to individuals' identification details. Selling the not directly identifiable data will give additional income to our firm.",

      "textCondensed": "For our firm, the following disadvantages arise from this model. Firstly, not directly identifiable data cannot be used for applying methods of price or service discrimination. The firm risks data breaches and liability issues. Therefore, our firm has to invest in data protection and should be informed about GDPR regulations. Furthermore, users' switching costs to other apps cannot be increased by personalising the content presented. As far as users are concerned, it is also harder for our company to gain consumers confidence, while users might be already deterred by the sale of not directly identifiable data. Overall, there might sill arise competitive disadvantages compared to companies that collect and sell directly identifiable data. In addition, a further disadvantage may arise if the sale of the data creates the same advantages from processing the data for competitors as for our firm.",

      "textCondensed": "For the user, the following advantages arise from this model. Users might feel less concerned about the loss of privacy. Since the data is not directly identifiable, there will not be given any bargaining power to third parties. Further, the consumers will have only few information costs in terms of privacy protection and no sign-up costs when entering the app. Personal costs due to data breaches will not arise.",

With not directly identifiable data being collected, users can neither profit from the targeted advertisement which reduces searching costs nor from possible discounts (e.g. on insurance fees). Further, they cannot benefit from personalised content and statistics. However, since their data is sold to third parties they might be concerned about the loss of control over their data.",

      "textCondensed": "Since not directly identifiable data is collected, socially beneficial predictions can be made. Especially in the healthcare sector, these predictions can be very valuable for governments and healthcare institutions. Furthermore, the data collected cannot be used to make individually differentiated predictions about non-users. This is known as 'negative privacy externalities' and would affect uninvolved third parties negatively. These externalities can be prevented by this model.",
